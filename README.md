React Native brings [React's](https://reactnative.dev/) declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.

- Declarative. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- Component-Based. Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- Developer Velocity. See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
- Portability. Reuse code across iOS, Android, and [other platforms](https://reactnative.dev/docs/out-of-tree-platforms).
- React Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors. Find out more in our [ecosystem overview](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/HEAD/ECOSYSTEM.md).
